ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Dragon Ball GT #1,2.ts.mka
* QQPCDownload1600.exe
* R.txt
* classes.jar
* constraint-layout-1.1.1.aar
* diannaoguanjia@2345_35235.exe
* glide-4.3.1.jar
* glide-4.7.1.jar
* glide-4.7.1.pom
* gson-2.8.0.jar
* jstarkan.exe
* litepal-1.6.1.jar
* okhttp-3.10.0.jar
* qqpcmgr_v12.13.19475.203_1324_0.exe
* sogou_pinyin_90b.exe
* vs_community__895456036.1526899703.exe

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => libs\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => libs\src\main\assets
* res\ => libs\src\main\res\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
